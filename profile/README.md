Cecil is a CLI application, powered by [PHP](http://www.php.net), that merge plain text files (written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)), images and [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) templates to generate a [static website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page).

Cecil is maintained by [Arnaud Ligny](https://arnaudligny.fr), a web & mobile consultant.
