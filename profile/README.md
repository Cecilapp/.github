Cecil is a CLI application, powered by [PHP](https://github.com/topics/php), that merge plain text files (written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)), images and [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com) templates to generate a [static website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page).

Cecil is maintained by [Arnaud Ligny](https://github.com/ArnaudLigny).
